\subsection*{The Sea Beast}
\lettrine[lines=3, slope=0.5em]{\textcolor{red}{A}}{\ nd he stood upon the sand of the sea.}

\zz And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems,%
	\cbiblefootduosbch{Daniel}{7:3-7}{Four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a man’s heart was given to it. And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns}%
					   {7:24-27}{As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings. And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time. But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.} %
and upon his heads names of blasphemy. 
\vnum{2}And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority. 
\vnum{3}And I saw one of his heads as though it had been smitten unto death; and his death-stroke was healed.

And the whole earth wondered after the beast; 
\vnum{4}and they worshipped the dragon, because he gave his authority unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast?%
	\cbiblefoot{Exodus}{15:11}{Who is like unto thee, O Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, doing wonders?} %
and who is able to war with him? 

\vnum{5}And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies;%
	\cbiblefootcuatrosbch{Daniel}{7:8}{I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things}%
				       {7:11}{I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire}%
					   {7:20}{Concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows}
					   {7:25}{He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.} %
and there was given to him authority to continue forty and two months. 
\vnum{6}And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, even them that dwell in the heaven.%
	\cbiblefoot{Daniel}{11:36-37}{The king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods; and he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined shall be done. Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall magnify himself above all.} %
\vnum{7}And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation. 
\vnum{8}And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, every one whose name hath not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life%
	\cbiblefoot{Daniel}{12:1}{At that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.} %
of the Lamb that hath been slain. 
\vnum{9}If any man hath an ear, let him hear. 
\begin{verse}
\vleftofline{\vnum{10}}If any man is for captivity, into captivity he goeth:\\* if any man shall kill with the sword, with the sword must he be killed.%
	\cbiblefootduosb{Jeremiah}{15:2}{It shall come to pass, when they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith Jehovah: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity}%
					{43:11}{He shall come, and shall smite the land of Egypt; such as are for death shall be given to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.}%
\end{verse}

Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
\subsection*{The Land Beast}
\vnum{11}And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns%
	\cbiblefoot{Daniel}{8:3}{I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.} %
like unto a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. 
\vnum{12}And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his sight. And he maketh the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose death-stroke was healed. 
\vnum{13}And he doeth great signs, that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven upon the earth in the sight of men.%
	\cbiblefoot{IKings}{18:38}{The fire of Jehovah fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, Jehovah, he is God; Jehovah, he is God!} %
\vnum{14}And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who hath the stroke of the sword and lived. 

\vnum{15}And it was given unto him to give breath to it, even to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as should not worship the image of the beast should be killed.%
	\cbiblefoot{Daniel}{3:4-6}{The herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up; and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.} %
\vnum{16}And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, that there be given them a mark on their right hand, or upon their forehead;%
	\cbiblefootduo{Isaiah}{44:5}{One shall say, I am Jehovah’s; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto Jehovah, and surname himself by the name of Israel}%
				  {Exodus}{28:36-38}{Thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, Holy to Jehovah\ldots and it shall be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be. And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead\ldots} %
\vnum{17}and that no man should be able to buy or to sell, save he that hath the mark, even the name of the beast or the number of his name. 

\vnum{18}Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man: and his number is six hundred and sixty and six.
