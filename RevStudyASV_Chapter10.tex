\chapter{The Angel and \linebreak[0] \mbox{the Little Scroll}}
\lettrine[lines=3,slope=0.5em]{\textcolor{red}{A}}{\ nd} I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, arrayed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head,%
	\cbiblefoot{Ezekiel}{1:28}{As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah.} %
and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire;%
	\cbiblefoot{Exodus}{13:21-22}{Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; that they might go by day and by night: the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people.} %
\vnum{2}and he had in his hand a little book open:%
	\cbiblefoot{Ezekiel}{2:9}{When I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein.} %
and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth; 
\vnum{3}and he cried with a great voice, as a lion roareth:%
	\footnote{%
		\cbibleref{Hosea}{11:10}{They shall walk after Jehovah, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west} %
		\cbibleref{Amos}{3:8}{The lion hath roared; who will not fear? The Lord Jehovah hath spoken; who can but prophesy?} %
		\cbibleref{Jeremiah}{25:30-31}{Jehovah will roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he will mightily roar against his fold; he will give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the nations; he will enter into judgment with all flesh.}
	} %
 and when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.%
	\cbiblefootduo{ISamuel}{7:10}{Jehovah thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten down before Israel.} %
				{Psalms}{29:3-9}{The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth, even Jehovah upon many waters. The voice of Jehovah is powerful; the voice of Jehovah is full of majesty. The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars; yea, Jehovah breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox. The voice of Jehovah cleaveth the flames of fire. The voice of Jehovah shaketh the wilderness; Jehovah shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to calve, and strippeth the forests bare.} %
\vnum{4}And when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.%
	\cbiblefootduosb{Daniel}{8:26}{The vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come}%
					{12:4, 9}{But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased\ldots Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end.} %
\vnum{5}And the angel that I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his right hand to heaven,%
	\cbiblefootduo{Deuteronomy}{32:40-41}{I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, As I live for ever, if I whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine adversaries}%
					{Daniel}{12:7}{I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half.} %
\vnum{6}and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein,%

		\cbibleref{Genesis}{14:19, 22}{[Melchizedek] blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth\ldots Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth} %
		\cbibleref{Exodus}{20:11}{In six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is} %
		\cbibleref{Nehemiah}{9:6}{Thou art Jehovah, even thou alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee} %

that there shall be delay no longer: 
\vnum{7}but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then is finished the mystery of God, according to the good tidings which he declared to his servants the prophets. 
\vnum{8}And the voice which I heard from heaven, I heard it again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. 
\vnum{9}And I went unto the angel, saying unto him that he should give me the little book. And he saith unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey. 
\vnum{10}And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.%
	\footnote{%
		\cbibleref{Ezekiel}{2:8-3:3}{Son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee. And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein\ldots He said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel. So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll. And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.} %
		\cbibleref{Jeremiah}{15:16-17}{Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by thy name, O Jehovah, God of hosts. I sat not in the assembly of them that make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand; for thou hast filled me with indignation} %
		\cbibleref{Psalms}{19:10}{More to be desired are [the ordinances of Jehovah] than gold\ldots sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb.} %
		\cbiblechvs{Psalms}{119:103}{How sweet are thy words unto my taste! Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!}\

\vnum{11}And they say unto me, Thou must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.
