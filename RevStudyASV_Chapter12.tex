\lettrine[lines=3,slope=0.5em]{\textcolor{red}{A}}{\ nd} a great sign was seen in heaven:%
	\cbiblefoot{Isaiah}{7:14}{Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and she will name Him Immanuel.} %
 a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars;%
 	\cbiblefootduo{Psalms}{104:1-2}{Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty: Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;}%
 					   {Genesis}{37:9}{He dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream; and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.} %
\vnum{2}and she was with child; and she crieth out, travailing in birth, and in pain to be delivered.%
	\footnote{\cbibleref{Isaiah}{26:17}{Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain and crieth out in her pangs; so we have been before thee, O Jehovah} %	
			  \cbiblechvs{Isaiah}{66:7-13}{ Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child. Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children. Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith Jehovah: shall I that cause to bring forth shut the womb? saith thy God. Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn over her; that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream: and ye shall suck thereof; ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees. As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.} %
			  \cbibleref{Micah}{4:9-13}{Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no king in thee, is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail? Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto Babylon: there shalt thou be rescued; there will Jehovah redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies. And now many nations are assembled against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see our desire upon Zion. But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, neither understand they his counsel; for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor. Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and I will devote their gain unto Jehovah, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.}} %
\vnum{3}And there was seen another sign in heaven: and behold, a great red\clearpage dragon,%
		\cbiblefootduo{Ezekiel}{29:3}{Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster [\textit{Septuagint (LXX): ``dragon''}] that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself}%
					  {Isaiah}{27:1}{In that day Jehovah with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan [\textit{LXX: ``dragon''}] the swift serpent, and leviathan [\textit{LXX: ``dragon''}] the crooked serpent; and he will slay the monster [\textit{LXX: ``dragon''}] that is in the sea.}
 having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems.
	\cbiblefootduosbch{Daniel}{7:7}{After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns}%
							  {7:23-24}{Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings}
\vnum{4}And his tail draweth the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth:%
	\cbiblefoot{Daniel}{8:10-11}{AAnd it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them. Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host\ldots}
 and the dragon standeth before the woman that is about to be delivered, that when she is delivered he may devour her child. 
\vnum{5}And she was delivered of a son, a man child,%
	\cbiblefoot{Isaiah}{7:14}{Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel}
 who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron:%
	\cbiblefoot{Psalms}{2:9}{Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.}
 and her child was caught up unto God, and unto his throne.
\vnum{6}And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God,%
	\cbiblefootduo{IKings}{17:1-6}{And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the sojourners of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word. And the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. So he went and did according unto the word of Jehovah; for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook}%
			      {Hosea}{2:14}{Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her}
 that there they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and threescore days.

\vnum{7}And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels going forth to war with the dragon; and the dragon warred and his angels;%
	\cbiblefootduosb{Daniel}{10:13, 20-21}{The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia\ldots Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come. But I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me against these, but Michael your prince}%
					{12:1}{And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book}
\vnum{8} and they prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven.%
	\cbiblefoot{Daniel}{2:35}{Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth}
\vnum{9}And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent,%
	\cbiblefootduosbch{Genesis}{3:1}{Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made}%
						{3:14-15}{And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel}
 he that is called the Devil and Satan,%
	\cbiblefootduo{Job}{1:6-7}{Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them. And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.}%
		{Zechariah}{3:1-2}{And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary. And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan; yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?}
 the deceiver of the whole world; he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him. 
\vnum{10}And I heard a great voice in heaven, saying,
\begin{verse}
Now is come the salvation, and the power,\\*\vin and the kingdom of our God,\\*\vin and the authority of his Christ:\\ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down,\\*\vin who accuseth them before our God day and night.%
	\cbiblefootduosb{Job}{1:9-11}{Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face}%
		{2:4-5}{And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face}\\
\vleftofline{\vnum{11}}And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb,\\*\vin and because of the word of their testimony;\\ and they loved not their life even unto death.\\ 
\vleftofline{\vnum{12}}Therefore rejoice, O heavens,\\*\vin and ye that dwell in them.%
	\footnote{\cbibleref{Isaiah}{44:23}{Sing, O ye heavens, for Jehovah hath done it; shout, ye lower parts of the earth; break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and will glorify himself in Israel} %
			  \cbiblechvs{Isaiah}{49:13}{Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for Jehovah hath comforted his people, and will have compassion upon his afflicted} %
			  \cbibleref{Psalms}{96:11-13}{Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein; Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy Before Jehovah; for he cometh, For he cometh to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with his truth}}\\
 Woe for the earth and for the sea:\\*\vin because the devil is gone down unto you,\\ having great wrath,\\*\vin knowing that he hath but a short time.
\end{verse}
\vnum{13}And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman that brought forth the man child. 
\vnum{14}And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle,%
	\cbiblefoottrio{Exodus}{19:4}{Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself}%
				   {Isaiah}{40:31}{They that wait for Jehovah shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint}%
				   {Ezekiel}{17:3, 7}{Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came unto Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar\ldots There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it}
 that she might fly into the wilderness unto her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time,%
	\cbiblefootduosb{Daniel}{7:25}{He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time}%
				    {12:7}{I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished}
 from the face of the serpent. 
\vnum{15}And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream. 
\vnum{16}And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.%
	\cbiblefootduo{Numbers}{16:30-34}{If Jehovah make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then ye shall understand that these men have despised Jehovah. And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them; and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly. And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up}%
				  {Deuteronomy}{11:6}{What he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel}
\vnum{17}And the dragon waxed wroth with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, that keep the commandments of God, and hold the testimony of Jesus.%
	\cbiblefoot{Genesis}{3:15}{I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel}
