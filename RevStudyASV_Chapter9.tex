\chapter{The Fifth and Sixth Trumpets}
\lettrine[lines=3,slope=0.5em]{\textcolor{red}{A}}{\ nd} the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven fallen unto the earth: and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss. 
\vnum{2} And he opened the pit of the abyss; and there went up a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace;%
	\cbiblefoot{Genesis}{19:28}{He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace}
 and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.%
	\cbiblefoot{Joel}{2:1-2, 10}{The day of Jehovah cometh, for it is nigh at hand; a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains\ldots The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.}
\vnum{3} And out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth;%
	\cbiblefootduo{Exodus}{10:12-15}{ Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left. And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt}%
					{Joel}{1:4}{That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten.}
 and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. 
\vnum{4} And it was said unto them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only such men as have not the seal of God on their foreheads.%
	\cbiblefoot{Ezekiel}{9:4-6}{Jehovah said unto him, Go through the midst of the city\ldots and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof. And to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye through the city after him, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity\ldots but come not near any man upon whom is the mark}
\vnum{5} And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when it striketh a man. 
\vnum{6} And in those days men shall seek death, and shall in no wise find it; and they shall desire to die, and death fleeth from them.%
	\cbiblefootduo{Job}{3:20-22}{Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul; who long for death, but it cometh not, and dig for it more than for hid treasures; who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?}%
				{Jeremiah}{8:3}{Death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith Jehovah of hosts}
\vnum{7} And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war;%
	\cbiblefoot{Joel}{2:4-11}{The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run. Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array. At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale. They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they break not their ranks. Neither doth one thrust another; they march every one in his path; and they burst through the weapons, and break not off their course. They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief. The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining. And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great}
 and upon their heads as it were crowns like unto gold, and their faces were as men’s faces. 
\vnum{8} And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.%
	\cbiblefoot{Joel}{1:6-7}{A nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw-teeth of a lioness. He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.}
\vnum{9} And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to war. 
\vnum{10} And they have tails like unto scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men five months. 
\vnum{11} They have over them as king the angel of the abyss: his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek tongue he hath the name Apollyon.

\vnum{12} The first Woe is past: behold, there come yet two Woes hereafter.

\vnum{13} And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,%
	\cbiblefoot{Exodus}{30:1-6}{And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon\ldots foursquare shall it be\ldots the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it. And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about\ldots And thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.}
\vnum{14} one saying to the sixth angel that had the trumpet, Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates. 
\vnum{15} And the four angels were loosed, that had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they should kill the third part of men. 
\vnum{16} And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand: I heard the number of them. 
\vnum{17} And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates as of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone: and the heads of the horses are as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceedeth fire and smoke and brimstone.%
	\cbiblefoot{Psalms}{11:6}{Upon the wicked he will rain snares; fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.}
\vnum{18} By these three plagues was the third part of men killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone, which proceeded out of their mouths. 
\vnum{19} For the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails are like unto serpents, and have heads; and with them they hurt. 
\vnum{20} And the rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands,%

 that they should not worship demons,%

			{Psalms}{106:36-38}{[They] served their idols, which became a snare unto them. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons, and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood}
 and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk:%

They that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them.}\ldots%

\vnum{21} and they repented not of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.%
