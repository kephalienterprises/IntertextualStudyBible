\subsection*{An innumerable multitude}
\vnum{9}After these things I saw, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands; %
\vnum{10}and they cry with a great voice, saying,
\begin{verse}
Salvation unto our God who sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb.
\end{verse}
\vnum{11}And all the angels were standing round about the throne, and about the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, %
\vnum{12}saying,
\begin{verse}
Amen:\\* Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever.\\* Amen.
\end{verse}
\vnum{13}And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, These that are arrayed in the white robes, who are they, and whence came they? %
\vnum{14}And I say unto him, My lord, thou knowest.%
	\cbiblefoot{Ezekiel}{37:3}{He said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest.} %
And he said to me, 
\begin{verse} 
These are they that come out of the great tribulation,%
 	\cbiblefoot{Daniel}{12:1}{There shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.}\\
  and they washed their robes,%
 	\cbiblefoot{Exodus}{19:10, 14}{Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments\ldots\ Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments.}\\
  and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\\ %
\vleftofline{\vnum{15}}Therefore are they before the throne of God;\\%
 and they serve him day and night in his temple:\\ and he that sitteth on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them.%
	\footnote{
		\cbibleref{Ezekiel}{37:23-28}{I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God. And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd\ldots\ and David my servant shall be their prince for ever\ldots I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.}
	}\\ %
\vleftofline{\vnum{16}}They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more;\\ neither shall the sun strike upon them, nor any heat:%
	\cbiblefoot{Isaiah}{49:10}{They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them will lead them, even by springs of water will he guide them.}\\ %
\vleftofline{\vnum{17}}for the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall be their shepherd,\\ and shall guide them unto fountains of waters of life:%
	\cbiblefootduo{Ezekiel}{34:22-24}{Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep. And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. And I, Jehovah, will be their God, and my servant David prince among them}%
				{Psalms}{23:1-3}{Jehovah is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: he guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies}\\
 and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.%
 	\cbiblefoot{Isaiah}{25:8-9}{He hath swallowed up death for ever; and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth: for Jehovah hath spoken it. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is Jehovah; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.}
