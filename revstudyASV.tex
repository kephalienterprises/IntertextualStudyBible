\subsection*{Letter to Ephesus}
\lettrine[lines=3]{\textcolor{red}{T}}{\ o the angel of the church in Ephesus write} :

\zz These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, he that walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks:%
	\cbiblefoot{Ezekiel}{28:14}{Thou wast the anointed cherub that covereth: and I set thee, so that thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire}
\vnum{2} I know thy works, and thy toil and patience, and that thou canst not bear evil men, and didst try them that call themselves apostles, and they are not, and didst find them false; %
\vnum{3} and thou hast patience and didst bear for my name’s sake, and hast not grown weary. %
\vnum{4} But I have this against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love.%
	\cbiblefoot{Jeremiah}{2:2-5}{Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals; how thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown. Israel was holiness unto Jehovah, the first-fruits of his increase: all that devour him shall be held guilty; evil shall come upon them, saith Jehovah\ldots Thus saith Jehovah, What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?}
\vnum{5} Remember%
	\cbiblefoottriosb{Ezekiel}{16:61-63}{Then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed\ldots And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah; that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord Jehovah}%
				{20:43}{And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have polluted yourselves; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed}%
				{36:31}{Then shall ye remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations}%
therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent. %
\vnum{6} But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.%
	\cbiblefoottriosb{Psalms}{26:5}{I hate the assembly of evil-doers, and will not sit with the wicked}%
			{101:3}{I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave unto me}%
			{139:21}{Do not I hate them, O Jehovah, that hate thee? And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?} %
\vnum{7} He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh, to him will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.%
	\cbiblefootduosb{Genesis}{2:9}{And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden}%
				{3:22-24}{And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever— therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life}

These things saith the first and the last, who was dead, and lived again: %
\vnum{9} I know thy tribulation, and thy poverty (but thou art rich), and the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. %
\vnum{10} Fear not the things which thou art about to suffer: behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days.%
	\cbiblefoot{Daniel}{1:12, 14}{Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink\ldots So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days.}%
 Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life. %
\vnum{11} He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.
\subsection*{Letter to Pergamum}
\vnum{12} And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write:

These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword:%
	\cbiblefoot{Isaiah}{49:2}{He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword}%
\vnum{13} I know where thou dwellest,%

The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever.

\vnum{16} And the four and twenty elders, who sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God, 
\vnum{17} saying,

We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art and who wast; because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign. 
\vnum{18} And the nations were wroth, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and the time to give their reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, the small and the great; and to destroy them that destroy the earth.

\vnum{19} And there was opened the temple of God that is in heaven; and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant; and there followed lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.

\vnum{2} and she was with child; and she crieth out, travailing in birth, and in pain to be delivered. 
\vnum{3} And there was seen another sign in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems. 
\vnum{4} And his tail draweth the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon standeth before the woman that is about to be delivered, that when she is delivered he may devour her child. 
\vnum{5} And she was delivered of a son, a man child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and unto his throne. 
\vnum{6} And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that there they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and threescore days.

\vnum{7} And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels going forth to war with the dragon; and the dragon warred and his angels; 
\vnum{8} and they prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven. 
\vnum{9} And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, he that is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world; he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him. 
\vnum{10} And I heard a great voice in heaven, saying,

Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accuseth them before our God day and night.

\vnum{14} And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness unto her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

\vnum{2} And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority. 
\vnum{3} And I saw one of his heads as though it had been smitten unto death; and his death-stroke was healed: and the whole earth wondered after the beast; 
\vnum{4} and they worshipped the dragon, because he gave his authority unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? and who is able to war with him? 
\vnum{5} and there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given to him authority to continue forty and two months. 
\vnum{6} And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, even them that dwell in the heaven. 
\vnum{7} And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation. 
\vnum{8} And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, every one whose name hath not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that hath been slain. 
\vnum{9} If any man hath an ear, let him hear. 
\vnum{10} If any man is for captivity, into captivity he goeth: if any man shall kill with the sword, with the sword must he be killed. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

\vnum{11} And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like unto a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. 
\vnum{12} And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his sight. And he maketh the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose death-stroke was healed. 
\vnum{13} And he doeth great signs, that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven upon the earth in the sight of men. 
\vnum{14} And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who hath the stroke of the sword and lived. 
\vnum{15} And it was given unto him to give breath to it, even to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as should not worship the image of the beast should be killed. 
\vnum{16} And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, that there be given them a mark on their right hand, or upon their forehead; 
\vnum{17} and that no man should be able to buy or to sell, save he that hath the mark, even the name of the beast or the number of his name. 
\vnum{18} Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred and sixty and six.

\vnum{3} and they sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, even they that had been purchased out of the earth. 
\vnum{4} These are they that were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, to be the first-fruits unto God and unto the Lamb. 
\vnum{5} And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish.

\vnum{6} And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people;

\vnum{8} And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

\vnum{9} And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand, 
\vnum{10} he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: 
\vnum{11} and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name. 
\vnum{12} Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

\vnum{13} And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.

\vnum{14} And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud I saw one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. 
\vnum{15} And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. 
\vnum{16} And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.

\vnum{17} And another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. 
\vnum{18} And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. 
\vnum{19} And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great winepress, of the wrath of God. 
\vnum{20} And the winepress was trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs.

\vnum{3} And the second poured out his bowl into the sea; and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living soul died, even the things that were in the sea.

\vnum{4} And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of the waters; and it became blood. 
\vnum{5} And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art and who wast, thou Holy One, because thou didst thus judge: 
\vnum{6} for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and blood hast thou given them to drink: they are worthy. 
\vnum{7} And I heard the altar saying, Yea, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.

\vnum{8} And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given unto it to scorch men with fire. 
\vnum{9} And men were scorched with great heat: and they blasphemed the name of God who hath the power over these plagues; and they repented not to give him glory.

\vnum{10} And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, 
\vnum{11} and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they repented not of their works.

\vnum{12} And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river, the river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way might be made ready for the kings that come from the sunrising. 
\vnum{13} And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as it were frogs: 
\vnum{14} for they are spirits of demons, working signs; which go forth unto the kings of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty. 
\vnum{15} (Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.) 
\vnum{16} And they gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew Har-Magedon.

\vnum{17} And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and there came forth a great voice out of the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done: 
\vnum{18} and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men upon the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty. 
\vnum{19} And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. 
\vnum{20} And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. 
\vnum{21} And great hail, every stone about the weight of a talent, cometh down out of heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof is exceeding great.

\vnum{3} And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. 
\vnum{4} And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, even the unclean things of her fornication, 
\vnum{5} and upon her forehead a name written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Harlots and of the Abominations of the Earth. 
\vnum{6} And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with a great wonder. 
\vnum{7} And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns. 
\vnum{8} The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition. And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, they whose name hath not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast, how that he was, and is not, and shall come. 
\vnum{9} Here is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth: 
\vnum{10} and they are seven kings; the five are fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a little while. 
\vnum{11} And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goeth into perdition. 
\vnum{12} And the ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour. 
\vnum{13} These have one mind, and they give their power and authority unto the beast. 
\vnum{14} These shall war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they also shall overcome that are with him, called and chosen and faithful. 
\vnum{15} And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. 
\vnum{16} And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her utterly with fire. 
\vnum{17} For God did put in their hearts to do his mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished. 
\vnum{18} And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.

\vnum{8} and shall come forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. 
\vnum{9} And they went up over the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them. 
\vnum{10} And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

\vnum{11} And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. 
\vnum{12} And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne; and books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works. 
\vnum{13} And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. 
\vnum{14} And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, even the lake of fire. 
\vnum{15} And if any was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.

\chapter{The New Heaven and Earth}
\lettrine[lines=3,slope=-0.5em]{\textcolor{red}{A}}{\ nd I saw a new heaven and a new earth}: for the first heaven and the first earth are passed away; and the sea is no more. 
\vnum{2} And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband. 
\vnum{3} And I heard a great voice out of the throne saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them, and they shall be his peoples, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God: 
\vnum{4} and he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more; neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more: the first things are passed away. 
\vnum{5} And he that sitteth on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he saith, Write: for these words are faithful and true. 
\vnum{6} And he said unto me, They are come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. 
\vnum{7} He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. 
\vnum{8} But for the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part shall be in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.

\vnum{9} And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were laden with the seven last plagues; and he spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb. 
\vnum{10} And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, 
\vnum{11} having the glory of God: her light was like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal: 
\vnum{12} having a wall great and high; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: 
\vnum{13} on the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. 
\vnum{14} And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 
\vnum{15} And he that spake with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. 
\vnum{16} And the city lieth foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height thereof are equal. 
\vnum{17} And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. 
\vnum{18} And the building of the wall thereof was jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto pure glass. 
\vnum{19} The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; 
\vnum{20} the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. 
\vnum{21} And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the several gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. 
\vnum{22} And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof. 
\vnum{23} And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine upon it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp thereof is the Lamb. 
\vnum{24} And the nations shall walk amidst the light thereof: and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it. 
\vnum{25} And the gates thereof shall in no wise be shut by day (for there shall be no night there): 
\vnum{26} and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it: 
\vnum{27} and there shall in no wise enter into it anything unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a lie: but only they that are written in the Lamb’s book of life.

\chapter{The River and the Tree of Life}
\lettrine[lines=3,slope=-0.5em]{\textcolor{red}{A}}{\ nd he showed me a river} of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, 
\vnum{2} in the midst of the street thereof. And on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve manner of fruits, yielding its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 
\vnum{3} And there shall be no curse any more: and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be therein: and his servants shall serve him; 
\vnum{4} and they shall see his face; and his name shall be on their foreheads. 
\vnum{5} And there shall be night no more; and they need no light of lamp, neither light of sun; for the Lord God shall give them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.

\vnum{6} And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass. 
\vnum{7} And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.

\vnum{8} And I John am he that heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things. 
\vnum{9} And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets, and with them that keep the words of this book: worship God.

\vnum{10} And he saith unto me, Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand. 
\vnum{11} He that is unrighteous, let him do unrighteousness still: and he that is filthy, let him be made filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him do righteousness still: and he that is holy, let him be made holy still. 
\vnum{12} Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to each man according as his work is. 
\vnum{13} I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. 
\vnum{14} Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have the right to come to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city. 
\vnum{15} Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one that loveth and maketh a lie.

\vnum{16} I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright, the morning star.

\vnum{17} And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And he that heareth, let him say, Come. And he that is athirst, let him come: he that will, let him take the water of life freely.

\vnum{18} I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto them, God shall add unto him the plagues which are written in this book: 
\vnum{19} and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.

\vnum{20} He who testifieth these things saith, Yea: I come quickly. Amen: come, Lord Jesus.

\vnum{21} The grace of the Lord Jesus be with the saints. Amen.
