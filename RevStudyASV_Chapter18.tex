\chapter{Fallen, Fallen is Babylon}
\lettrine[lines=3,slope=0.5em]{\textcolor{red}{A}}{\ fter} these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was lightened with his glory.%
	\cbiblefoot{Ezekiel}{43:2}{And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory}
\vnum{2}And he cried with a mighty voice, saying, 
\begin{verse}
Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great,%
	\cbiblefoot{Isaiah}{21:9}{And, behold, here cometh a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods are broken unto the ground}\\*\vin
 and is become a habitation of demons,\\ and a hold of every unclean spirit,\\*\vin and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird.%
	\footnote{\cbibleref{Jeremiah}{9:10-11}{For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passeth through; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the birds of the heavens and the beasts are fled, they are gone. And I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant}\ldots %
			\cbibleref{Isaiah}{13:19-22}{And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans’ pride, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall shepherds make their flocks to lie down there. But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and ostriches shall dwell there, and wild goats shall dance there. And wolves shall cry in their castles, and jackals in the pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged}\ldots %
			\cbiblechvs{Isaiah}{34:9-15}{And the streams of Edom shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever. But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein: and he will stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness. They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there; and all its princes shall be nothing. And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof; and it shall be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches. And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves, and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest. There shall the dart-snake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shade; yea, there shall the kites be gathered, every one with her mate}}\\
\vleftofline{\vnum{3}}For by the wine of the wrath%
	\cbiblefootduosb{Jeremiah}{25:15}{For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto me: Take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it}%
			{51:7}{Babylon hath been a golden cup in Jehovah’s hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the nations are mad}
 of her fornication all the nations are fallen;\\ and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her,%
	\cbiblefoot{Isaiah}{23:17}{And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that Jehovah will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her hire, and shall play the harlot with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth}\\
 and the merchants of the earth waxed rich%
	\cbiblefootduo{Ezekiel}{27:33}{When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many peoples; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise}%
			{Isaiah}{23:8}{Who hath purposed this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?}
 by the power of her wantonness.
 \end{verse}

\vnum{4}And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, 
\begin{verse}
Come forth, my people, out of her,%
	\footnote{\cbibleref{Isaiah}{48:20}{Go ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say ye, Jehovah hath redeemed his servant Jacob}\ldots %

\vleftofline{\vnum{7}}How much soever she glorified herself, and waxed wanton,\\*\vin
so much give her of torment and mourning:\\

 when they look upon the smoke of her burning, 
\vnum{10}standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, 
\begin{verse}
Woe, woe, the great city,\\*\vin Babylon, the strong city!\\ for in one hour is thy judgment come. 
\end{verse}
\vnum{11}And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her,%

 for no man buyeth their merchandise any more; 
\vnum{12}merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet; and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;%
	\cbiblefoot{Ezekiel}{27:12-25}{Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded for thy wares.

They of the house of Togarmah traded for thy wares with horses and war-horses and mules. The men of Dedan were thy traffickers; many isles were the mart of thy hand: they brought thee in exchange horns of ivory and ebony. Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of thy handiworks: they traded for thy wares with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies. Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy traffickers: they traded for thy merchandise wheat of Minnith, and pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm. Damascus was thy merchant for the multitude of thy handiworks, by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches, with the wine of Helbon, and white wool. Vedan and Javan traded with yarn for thy wares: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were among thy merchandise. Dedan was thy trafficker in precious cloths for riding. Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were the merchants of thy hand; in lambs, and rams, and goats, in these were they thy merchants. The traffickers of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy traffickers; they traded for thy wares with the chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.

\vnum{21}And a strong angel took up a stone as it were a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying,
