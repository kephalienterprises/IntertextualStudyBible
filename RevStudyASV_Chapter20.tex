\lettrine[lines=3,slope=0.5em]{\textcolor{red}{A}}{\ nd I saw an angel coming down out of heaven}, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. 
\vnum{2}And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, 
\vnum{3}and cast him into the abyss, and shut it,%
	\cbiblefoot{Isaiah}{24:21-22}{It shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison; and after many days shall they be visited.} %
and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years should be finished: after this he must be loosed for a little time.

\vnum{4}And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them:%
	\footnote{\cbibleref{Daniel}{7:9}{I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire} %
			  \cbiblevs{Daniel}{7:22}{Until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.}} %
and I saw the souls of them that had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as worshipped not the beast, neither his image, and received not the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand; and they lived,%
	\cbiblefoot{Ezekiel}{37:10}{I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.} %
and reigned with Christ a thousand years.%
	\cbiblefoot{Daniel}{7:27}{The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.} %
\vnum{5}The rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years should be finished. This is the first resurrection. 
\vnum{6}Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.

\vnum{7}And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, 
\vnum{8}and shall come forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth,%
	\cbiblefoot{Ezekiel}{7:2}{Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto the land of Israel, An end: the end is come upon the four corners of the land} %
Gog and Magog,%
	\footnote{\cbibleref{Ezekiel}{38:1-39:16}{And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, set thy face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal: and I will turn thee about, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth\ldots Persia, Cush, and Put with them\ldots Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north, and all his hordes; even many peoples with thee\ldots Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In that day when my people Israel dwelleth securely, shalt thou not know it? And thou shalt come from thy place out of the uttermost parts of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army; and thou shalt come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes\ldots And it shall come to pass in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils\ldots And I will send a fire on Magog, and on them that dwell securely in the isles; and they shall know that I am Jehovah\ldots And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of them that pass through on the east of the sea; and it shall stop them that pass through: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and they shall call it The valley of Hamon-gog. And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land\ldots}} %
to gather them together to the war: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.%
	\footnote{\cbibleref{Joshua}{11:4}{They went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many} %
			  \cbibleref{Judges}{7:12}{The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude} %
			  \cbibleref{ISamuel}{13:5}{The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth-aven.}} %
\vnum{9}And they went up over the breadth of the earth,%
	\cbiblefoot{Habakkuk}{1:6}{Lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.} %
 and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city:%
	\footnote{\cbibleref{Psalms}{78:68}{But [he] chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved} %
			  \cbiblechvs{Psalms}{87:2}{Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.}} %
and fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them.%
	\footnote{\cbibleref{IIKings}{1:10, 12}{Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty\ldots And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty} %
			  \cbibleref{Ezekiel}{38:22}{With pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him; and I will rain upon him, and upon his hordes, and upon the many peoples that are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone} %
			  \cbiblechvs{Ezekiel}{39:6}{I will send a fire on Magog, and on them that dwell securely in the isles; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.}} %
\vnum{10}And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

\vnum{11}And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away;%
	\cbiblefoot{Psalms}{114:3-7}{The sea saw it, and fled; the Jordan was driven back. The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs. What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back? Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; ye little hills, like lambs? Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob.} %
and there was found no place for them.%
	\cbiblefoot{Daniel}{2:35}{Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.} %
\vnum{12}And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne; and books were opened:%
	\cbiblefoot{Daniel}{7:10}{A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.} %
and another book was opened, which is the book of life:%
	\cbiblefoot{Isaiah}{4:3}{It shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem.} %
and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works.%
	\cbiblefoot{Psalms}{28:4}{Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings: give them after the operation of their hands; render to them their desert.} %
\vnum{13}And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. 
\vnum{14}And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire.%
	\cbiblefoot{Isaiah}{25:8}{He hath swallowed up death for ever; and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth: for Jehovah hath spoken it.} %
This is the second death, even the lake of fire. 
\vnum{15}And if any was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.
