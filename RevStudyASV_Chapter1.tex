\vleftofline{\vnum{7}}Behold, he cometh with the clouds;%
	\footnote{\cbibleref{Psalms}{18:9-12}{He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and thick darkness was under his feet. And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind. He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him, darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies. At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire} %
				\cbiblechvs{Psalms}{97:1-2}{Jehovah reigneth\ldots\ clouds and darkness are round about him} %
				\cbibleref{Isaiah}{19:1}{Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a swift cloud, and cometh unto Egypt} %

and they that pierced him; \\*%
and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn over him.%
	\cbiblefoot{Zechariah}{12:10-14}{They shall look unto me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born. In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. And the land shall mourn, every family apart.}

\noindent Even so, Amen.

\vnum{8}I am the Alpha and the Omega,%
	\cbiblefootcuartosb{Isaiah}{41:4}{I, Jehovah, the first, and with the last, I am he}%
	{43:10}{I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me}%

saith the Lord God, who is%

\subsubsection*{Vision of Christ}

\vnum{9}I John, your brother and partaker with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patience which are in Jesus, was in the isle that is called Patmos,%
	\footnote{\cbibleref{Ezekiel}{1:1}{As I was among the captives by the river Chebar\ldots\ the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God} %
			\cbibleref{Daniel}{8:2}{I saw in the vision\ldots\ when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai} %
			\cbiblechvs{Daniel}{10:4-5}{As I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel, I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold\ldots}} %
for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. %
\vnum{10}I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet %
\vnum{11}saying, What thou seest, write in a book%
\cbiblefoottrio{Isaiah}{30:8}{Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever}%
				{Jeremiah}{30:2}{Thus speaketh Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book}%
				{Habakkuk}{2:2}{Jehovah answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it.} %
and send it to the seven churches: unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamum, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.

\vnum{12}And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And having turned I saw seven golden candlesticks;%
	\cbiblefootduo{Exodus}{25:31-40}{Thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold\ldots\ thou shalt make the lamps thereof, seven: and they shall light the lamps thereof, to give light over against it\ldots\ See that thou make them after their pattern, which hath been showed thee in the mount}%
	{Zechariah}{4:2}{He said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have seen, and, behold, a candlestick all of gold, with its bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are upon the top thereof.} %
\vnum{13}and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto a son of man,%
\cbiblefoottrio{Ezekiel}{1:26}{Upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above}%
			{Daniel}{7:13}{I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him}%
			{Daniel}{10:16}{Behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips.} %
clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle.%
	\cbiblefoot{Daniel}{10:5}{I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz.}
\vnum{14}And his head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow;%
	\cbiblefoot{Daniel}{7:9}{I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool.} %
and his eyes were as a flame of fire;%
	\cbiblefoot{Daniel}{10:6}{His face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches.} %
\vnum{15}and his feet like unto burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace;%
	\cbiblefootduosb{Ezekiel}{1:7}{The sole of their feet\ldots\ sparkled like burnished brass}%
			{1:27}{I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.} %
and his voice as the voice of many waters.%
	\cbiblefootduo{Ezekiel}{1:24}{ I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host.}%
	{Psalms}{93:3-4}{The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, Jehovah on high is mighty.} %
\vnum{16}And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword:%
	\cbiblefootduosb{Isaiah}{11:4}{He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked}%
				{49:2}{He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword.} %
and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.%
	\cbiblefootduo{Isaiah}{60:19-20}{The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but Jehovah will be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for Jehovah will be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended}%
			{Malachi}{4:2}{But unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings.}

\vnum{17}And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead.%
\footnote{\cbibleref{Ezekiel}{1:28}{This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face} %
				\cbibleref{Daniel}{8:18}{Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground} %
				\cbiblechvs{Daniel}{10:8-9}{So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength. Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground} %
				\cbiblechvs{Daniel}{10:15-17}{When he had spoken unto me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb. And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I retain no strength. For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.}} %
And he laid his right hand upon me,%
	\cbiblefootduosb{Daniel}{8:18}{I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright}%
					{10:18-19}{Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me. And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spake unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.} %	
saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last, %
\vnum{18}and the Living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades. %
\vnum{19}Write therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass hereafter; %
\vnum{20}the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks are seven churches.
