\lettrine[lines=3,slope=0.5em]{\textcolor{red}{A}}{\ nd} I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues,%
	\cbiblefoot{Leviticus}{26:21}{And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins}
 which are the last, for in them is finished the wrath of God.

\vnum{2}And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass, having harps of God. 
\vnum{3}And they sing the song of Moses%
	\cbiblefoot{Exodus}{15:1-18}{Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto Jehovah, and spake, saying, I will sing unto Jehovah, for he hath triumphed gloriously: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea\ldots Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever}

\vnum{5}And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:

\vnum{8}And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power;%
	\footnote{\cbibleref{Isaiah}{6:1-4}{In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim\ldots And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke}\ldots %
			 \cbibleref{Exodus}{40:34-35}{Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle}\ldots %
