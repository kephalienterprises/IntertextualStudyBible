\chapter{The Seventh Seal: Trumpets}
\lettrine[lines=3]{\textcolor{red}{A}}{\ nd} when he opened the seventh seal, there followed a silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.%
	\cbiblefoottrio{Zechariah}{2:13}{Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation}%
				{Habakkuk}{2:20}{Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him}%
				{Zephaniah}{1:7}{Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord Jehovah; for the day of Jehovah is at hand: for Jehovah hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath consecrated his guests.} %
\vnum{2}And I saw the seven angels that stand before God; and there were given unto them seven trumpets.

\vnum{3}And another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints%
	\cbiblefoot{Psalms}{141:2}{Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee; The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.}
 upon the golden altar which was before the throne.%
	\cbiblefoot{Exodus}{30:1-8}{Thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of acacia wood shalt thou make it\ldots And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold\ldots And thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of sweet spices: every morning, when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn it. And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations.} %
\vnum{4}And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand. %
\vnum{5}And the angel taketh the censer; and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth:%
	\cbiblefoot{Ezekiel}{10:2}{He spake unto the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.}
 and there followed thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake.%
 	\cbiblefoot{Isaiah}{29:6}{She shall be visited of Jehovah of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.}
\subsection*{The Trumpets}
\vnum{6}And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.

\vnum{7}And the first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth:%
	\cbiblefootduo{Exodus}{9:23-25}{Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down unto the earth\ldots So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous\ldots The hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.}%
					{Ezekiel}{38:22-23}{With pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him; and I will rain upon him, and upon his hordes, and upon the many peoples that are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. And I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.}
 and the third part%
	\cbiblefoot{Ezekiel}{5:12}{A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and a third part I will scatter unto all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.}
 of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.

\vnum{8}And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea:%
	\cbiblefoot{Jeremiah}{51:25-26}{Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith Jehovah, which destroyest all the earth; and I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain. 26 And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith Jehovah.}
 and the third part of the sea became blood;%
	\cbiblefoot{Exodus}{7:20-21}{Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. 21 And the fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.}%
\vnum{9}and there died the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, even they that had life; and the third part of the ships was destroyed.

\vnum{10}And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell%
	\cbiblefoot{Isaiah}{14:12-15}{How art thou fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, that didst lay low the nations! And thou saidst in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I will sit upon the mount of congregation, in the uttermost parts of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to Sheol, to the uttermost parts of the pit.}
 upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters; %
\vnum{11}and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.%
	\cbiblefootduosb{Jeremiah}{9:13-15}{Jehovah saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein\ldots Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.}%
							{23:15}{Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land.}

\vnum{12}And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner.%
	\cbiblefootduo{Exodus}{10:21}{Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt}%
				{Amos}{8:9}{It shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord Jehovah, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day.}

\vnum{13}And I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, for them that dwell on the earth,%
	\footnote{\cbibleref{Isaiah}{24:17}{Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth}\ldots%
					\cbiblechvs{Isaiah}{26:21}{Jehovah cometh forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain}\ldots%
					\cbibleref{Hosea}{4:1}{Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land.}
					}
 by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who are yet to sound.
